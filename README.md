My name is Paolo Bonomi and i'm from Milan, Italy. As a computer scientist, my interests span across the interconnected fields of computational geometry, machine learning, and software engineering. 

My passion and inclination for manipulating multi-dimensional data, as well as researching and developing new ML models, is what drew me to the exciting field of Computer Vision.

In addition i'm a naturally curious person, and that curiosity keeps pushing me to dig deep into how things really work. I don't plan on stopping at just using libraries; I'm all about understanding the finer details.

Talk to me about:
- CNN, CapsNet, Transformer, Behavioural Model, RL, etc.
- Computational Geometry
-  GPU program optimization
- Indie Games
- Mathematics and Physics
