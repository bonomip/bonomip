## HI EVERYONE!

My name is Paolo Bonomi and i'm from Milan (Italy). As computer scientist my interests ranges over video-game development and more recently on AI (with focus in Deep Learning).

During my academic years i've found pleasure in developing videogames, therefore most of my github's projects are videogames.
Right now i'm working at [AISLAB](https://ais-lab.di.unimi.it/) on my master's thesis. The main purpose of the thesis is to analyse and unravel Capsule Networks ( [code](https://github.com/bonomip/CapsNetwork) ) as robust image classification model.

### Talk to me about...
- Artificial Intelligence (CNN, CapsNet, Transformer, Behaviour Model)
- GPU program optimization
- Mathematics and Physics
