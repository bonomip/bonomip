Hi, I'm Paolo Bonomi, a computer scientist from Milan, Italy. Iâ€™m interested in computational geometry, machine learning, and software engineeringâ€”especially where these fields connect.

I really enjoy working with complex data and building new machine learning models. That interest led me to the world of Computer Vision, where I like solving problems that involve images and patterns.

I'm a curious person by nature, and I always want to understand how things work under the hoodâ€”not just use libraries or tools, but really learn whatâ€™s happening behind the scenes.

Some of the topics I like to explore:
- Deep Learning (like CNNs, Transformers, Reinforcement Learning)
- Computational Geometry
- GPU Programming and Making Code Run Faste
- Indie Game Development
- Math and Physics
