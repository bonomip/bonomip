My name is Paolo Bonomi and i'm from Milan, Italy. As a computer scientist, my interests span across the interconnected fields of computational geometry, machine learning, and software engineering. 

My passion and inclination for manipulating multi-dimensional data, as well as researching and developing new ML models, is what drew me to the exciting field of Computer Vision.

In addition i'm a naturally curious person, and that curiosity keeps pushing me to dig deep into how things really work. I don't plan on stopping at just using libraries; I'm all about understanding the finer details.

Talk to me about:
- CNN, CapsNet, Transformer, Behavioural Model, RL, etc.
- Computational Geometry
-  GPU program optimization
- Indie Games
- Mathematics and Physics

## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

[CapsNetwork](https://github.com/bonomip/CapsNetwork) â€“ A PyTorch implementation of Capsule Networks, based on Hinton's dynamic routing architecture, designed to improve spatial understanding over traditional CNNs. Includes tools for training, evaluation, and result visualization on MNIST.

[DroneDelivery](https://github.com/bonomip/DroneDelivery) â€“ A Java-based prototype for a distributed drone delivery system. Utilizes REST APIs and MQTT messaging via the Mosquitto broker, with Gradle for build automation. Simulates real-time drone task coordination.

[Coons Patch Visualizer](https://github.com/bonomip/coons-patch) â€“ An interactive web app built with JavaScript and p5.js to visualize Coons patches. Allows manipulation of boundary curves and blending functions for educational exploration in computational geometry.

[vPhysic](https://github.com/bonomip/vPhysics) â€“ An C++ project that implements a basic Verlet physics engine using OpenGL for real-time visualization. It simulates particle systems and physics constraints in an interactive graphical environment.

[ExploRace](https://github.com/bonomip/Explorace) â€“ An online multiplayer game prototype developed in Unity using C#. It focuses on exploration and racing mechanics, showcasing basic networking and gameplay features.
